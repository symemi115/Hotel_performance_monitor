# **Hotel bookings and performance Monitor**

## **Data Description** :
This project analyses hotel booking data containting guests demographics, reservation details and cancellation details from two portugues hotels during July 2015 to August 2017. The dataset has been cleaned, transformed with new calculated columns that have been created to specifically analyse booking lead times, guest type groups and seasonal patterns. This analysis focuses on three key business hypotheses:

### **Hypothesis 1**
Early booking problem: Bookings made far in advance cancel 2.4 more times more often than last minute bookings.

### **Hypothesis 2**
Hidden High value Group: Family bookings generate 35% more revenue per stay than single couple bookings.

### **Hypothesis 3**
The seasonal imbalance: We make 72% of our money in just three months.

### **Business Requirements**
The purpose of this engagment is to use data analysis to support two leadinh hotel companies in making informed, evidence based desicions that improve revenue performance and operational efficiency. As a Data Analyst my role is to identify patterns, trends and actionable insights that will help the business determine the most effective approach to meeting the requirements:
1. Reduce revenue loss resulting from booking cancellations by a minimum of 10%.Analyse customer behviour across booking channels,customer group and lead times to identify key drivers of cancellations and recommend appropriate stratergies.
2. Increase revenue generated by family and group bookings.Examine customer groups,booking behaviour, length of stay and price sensitivity to identify oppertunities to attract, retain and grow the family and group customer segments. 
3. Optimise seasonal staff levels. Assess historical occupency rates, demand patterns and staffing utalisation to ensure levels are align with seasonal demands, improving costs efficiency while maintaining service quality.

## Project planning:
 ***Phase 1*** : 
 1. Extract Data
 2. Clean Data
 3. Create calculated columns
 4. Prepare Data for Power BI importation and transformation

 ***Phase 2***:
 1. Set up Power BI
 2. Create measuring tools.
 3. Build 4 core visualisations (Monthly booking trends, cancellation anaylsis by time, Revenue by guest type, Hotel comparisons)
 4. Build a score card for key reults.

 ***Phase 3***:
 1. Test Hypotheses
 2. Document findings.
 3. Forumlate actionable recomendations.
 4. Add colour scehme for formatting.
 5. Create dashboard.
 6. Export Dashboard for documentation.

### ***Data Source***
***Dataset:*** Hotel Booking Demand Dataset from Kaggle.
***Scope:*** 119,390 booking records for a Resort Hotel and a City Hotel.

***Period:*** July 2015 to August 2017.

***Contents:*** Guest demographics, reservation details, booking status, and pricing.

### ***Tools Used***
-Data Source: Kaggle Hotel Booking Demand Dataset (119,390 records)
-Analysis Platform: Power BI Desktop

### Key Findings:
### Hypothesis 1: Lead Time vs Cancellation Risk: Confirmed 
- **90+ day bookings:** 44% cancellation rate
- **0-7 day bookings:** 18% cancellation rate  
- **Risk multiplier:** 2.4x higher for early bookings
- **Business implication:** Early bookings cancel significantly more, requiring policy intervention

### Hypothesis 2: Family Segment Value: confirmed 
- **Families spend:** $420 average per stay
- **Couples spend:** $310 average per stay
- **Revenue premium:** $110 (35% higher)
- **Market opportunity:** Families represent only 15% of current bookings

### Hypothesis 3: Resort Seasonality: Cofirmed 
- **Resort Hotel:** 72% of revenue in summer (June-August)
- **City Hotel:** 48% of revenue in same period
- **Seasonal gap:** 24 percentage point difference
- **Operational impact:** Extreme peak-trough cycles for Resort hotels

## Analysis Methodology

### Data Processing
1. **Sampling:** 5,000 random bookings (4.2% of 119,390 total)
2. **Feature Engineering:** Created calculated columns:
   - `lead_time_category` (0-7, 8-30, 31-90, 90+ days)
   - `guest_type` (Family, Couple, Solo, Group)
   - `estimated_revenue` (ADR × total nights)
3. **Tools Used:** Python (pandas, numpy), Jupyter Notebook

### Statistical Validation
- Used descriptive statistics for hypothesis testing
- Calculated confidence intervals for key metrics
- Verified sample representativeness against full dataset

## Visualizations Created
1. **Cancellation Analysis:**
   - Bar chart: Cancellation rate by lead time category
   - Trend line: Increasing risk with longer lead times
2. **Revenue Segmentation:**
   - Bar chart: Average revenue by guest type
   - Pie chart: Booking share distribution
3. **Seasonal Patterns:**
   - Line chart: Monthly bookings comparison (City vs Resort)
   - Bar chart: Summer concentration percentage
