# **Hotel bookings and performance Monitor**

## **Data Description** :
This project analyses hotel booking data containting guests demographics, reservation details and cancellation details from two portugues hotels during July 2015 to August 2017. The dataset has been cleaned, transformed with new calculated columns that have been created to specifically analyse booking lead times, guest type groups and seasonal patterns. This analysis focuses on three key business hypotheses:

### **Hypothesis 1**
Early booking problem: Bookings made far in advance cancel 2.4 more times more often than last minute bookings.

### **Hypothesis 2**
Hidden High value Group: Family bookings generate 35% more revenue per stay than single couple bookings.

### **Hypothesis 3**
The seasonal imbalance: We make 72% of our money in just three months.

### **Business Requirements**
The purpose of this engagment is to use data analysis to support two leadinh hotel companies in making informed, evidence based desicions that improve revenue performance and operational efficiency. As a Data Analyst my role is to identify patterns, trends and actionable insights that will help the business determine the most effective approach to meeting the requirements:
1. Reduce revenue loss resulting from booking cancellations by a minimum of 10%.Analyse customer behviour across booking channels,customer group and lead times to identify key drivers of cancellations and recommend appropriate stratergies.
