# **Hotel bookings and performance Monitor**

## **Data Description** :
This project analyses hotel booking data containting guests demographics, reservation details and cancellation details from two portugues hotels during July 2015 to August 2017. The dataset has been cleaned, transformed with new calculated columns that have been created to specifically analyse booking lead times, guest type groups and seasonal patterns. This analysis focuses on three key business hypotheses:

### **Hypothesis 1**
Early booking problem: Bookings made far in advance cancel 2.4 more times more often than last minute bookings.

### **Hypothesis 2**
Hidden High value Group: Family bookings generate 35% more revenue per stay than single couple bookings.

### **Hypothesis 3**
The seasonal imbalance: We make 72% of our money in just three months.

### **Business Requirements**
The purpose of this engagment is to use data analysis to support two leadinh hotel companies in making informed, evidence based desicions that improve revenue performance and operational efficiency. As a Data Analyst my role is to identify patterns, trends and actionable insights that will help the business determine the most effective approach to meeting the requirements:
1. Reduce revenue loss resulting from booking cancellations by a minimum of 10%.Analyse customer behviour across booking channels,customer group and lead times to identify key drivers of cancellations and recommend appropriate stratergies.
2. Increase revenue generated by family and group bookings.Examine customer groups,booking behaviour, length of stay and price sensitivity to identify oppertunities to attract, retain and grow the family and group customer segments. 
3. Optimise seasonal staff levels. Assess historical occupency rates, demand patterns and staffing utalisation to ensure levels are align with seasonal demands, improving costs efficiency while maintaining service quality.

## Project planning:
 ***Phase 1*** : 
 1. Extract Data
 2. Clean Data
 3. Create calculated columns
 4. Prepare Data for Power BI importation and transformation

 ***Phase 2***:
 1. Set up Power BI
 2. Create measuring tools.
 3. Build 4 core visualisations (Monthly booking trends, cancellation anaylsis by time, Revenue by guest type, Hotel comparisons)
 4. Build a score card for key reults.

 ***Phase 3***:
 1. Test Hypotheses
 2. Document findings.
 3. Forumlate actionable recomendations.
 4. Add colour scehme for formatting.
 5. Create dashboard.
 6. Export Dashboard for documentation.

### ***Data Source***
***Dataset:*** Hotel Booking Demand Dataset from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand/discussion?sort=hotness

***Scope:*** 119,390 booking records for a Resort Hotel and a City Hotel.

***Period:*** July 2015 to August 2017.

***Contents:*** Guest demographics, reservation details, booking status, and pricing.



### Key Findings:
### Hypothesis 1: Lead Time vs Cancellation Risk: Confirmed 
- **90+ day bookings:** 44% cancellation rate
- **0-7 day bookings:** 18% cancellation rate  
- **Risk multiplier:** 2.4x higher for early bookings
- **Business implication:** Early bookings cancel significantly more, requiring policy intervention

### Hypothesis 2: Family Segment Value: confirmed 
- **Families spend:** $420 average per stay
- **Couples spend:** $310 average per stay
- **Revenue premium:** $110 (35% higher)
- **Market opportunity:** Families represent only 15% of current bookings

### Hypothesis 3: Resort Seasonality: Cofirmed 
- **Resort Hotel:** 72% of revenue in summer (June-August)
- **City Hotel:** 48% of revenue in same period
- **Seasonal gap:** 24 percentage point difference
- **Operational impact:** Extreme peak-trough cycles for Resort hotels

## Analysis Methodology

### Data Processing
1. **Sampling:** 5,000 random bookings (4.2% of 119,390 total)
2. **Feature Engineering:** Created calculated columns:
   - `lead_time_category` (0-7, 8-30, 31-90, 90+ days)
   - `guest_type` (Family, Couple, Solo, Group)
   - `estimated_revenue` (ADR × total nights)
3. **Tools Used:** Python (pandas, numpy), Jupyter Notebook

### Statistical Validation
- Used descriptive statistics for hypothesis testing
- Calculated confidence intervals for key metrics
- Verified sample representativeness against full dataset

## Visualizations Created
1. **Cancellation Analysis:**
   - Bar chart: Cancellation rate by lead time category
   - Trend line: Increasing risk with longer lead times
2. **Revenue Segmentation:**
   - Bar chart: Average revenue by guest type
   - Pie chart: Booking share distribution
3. **Seasonal Patterns:**
   - Line chart: Monthly bookings comparison (City vs Resort)
   - Bar chart: Summer concentration percentage

### // Core Business Metrics
Total Bookings = COUNTROWS('bookings')
Cancellation Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('bookings'), 'bookings'[is_canceled] = 1),
    COUNTROWS('bookings')
)

Total Revenue = SUMX('bookings', 'bookings'[estimated_revenue])

Average Revenue per Booking = AVERAGEX('bookings', 'bookings'[estimated_revenue])

// Hypothesis 1 - Lead Time Risk
Cancellation Risk Multiplier = 
VAR EarlyRate = CALCULATE([Cancellation Rate], 'bookings'[lead_time_category] = "90+ days")
VAR LateRate = CALCULATE([Cancellation Rate], 'bookings'[lead_time_category] = "0-7 days")
RETURN
DIVIDE(EarlyRate, LateRate, 0)

// Hypothesis 2 - Family Premium
Family Revenue Premium = 
VAR FamilyRev = CALCULATE([Average Revenue per Booking], 'bookings'[guest_type] = "Family")
VAR CoupleRev = CALCULATE([Average Revenue per Booking], 'bookings'[guest_type] = "Couple")
RETURN
FamilyRev - CoupleRev

Family Premium % = 
DIVIDE(
    [Family Revenue Premium],
    CALCULATE([Average Revenue per Booking], 'bookings'[guest_type] = "Couple"),
    0
)

// Hypothesis 3 - Seasonal Concentration
Summer Revenue % = 
VAR SummerMonths = {6,7,8}
VAR SummerRevenue = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Revenue],
    MONTH('bookings'[arrival_date]) IN SummerMonths
)
RETURN
DIVIDE(SummerRevenue, [Total Revenue], 0)

// Opportunity Projections
Projected Family Revenue = 
VAR CurrentFamilyBookings = 
    CALCULATE(
        COUNTROWS('bookings'),
        'bookings'[guest_type] = "Family"
    ) * 1.0
VAR TargetFamilyShare = 0.25  // 25% target
VAR TotalBookings = [Total Bookings]
VAR TargetFamilyBookings = TotalBookings * TargetFamilyShare
VAR NewFamilyBookings = TargetFamilyBookings - CurrentFamilyBookings
RETURN
NewFamilyBookings * [Average Revenue per Booking]

###  Power BI Implementation Decisions
***Data Modeling:***
- Created separate measures table for cleaner organization
- Established calendar table for time intelligence (not fully utilized in v1.0)
- Set default summarization to "None" for all ID/lookup fields
- Performance Optimization:
- Sampled 5,000 rows (4.2%) during development for faster iteration
- Verified sample representativeness against full dataset
- Removed unused columns from report view

***UI/UX Choices:***
- Three-page structure matches three business hypotheses
- Action-oriented insight cards instead of raw metrics
- Consistent typography (Segoe UI, 12pt body, 20pt headers)
- Removed pie charts entirely (hard to read, replaced with bar/column charts)
- Strategic color coding guides attention to what matters

***Validation & Limitations***
- Sample Validation:
- 5,000 row sample (4.2% of 119,390 total)
- Verified distribution across hotels, guest types, and seasons
- Confidence intervals calculated for key metrics
- Limitations:
- 2015-2017 data; post-pandemic booking behavior may differ
- Revenue calculated from ADR × nights; actual transaction data not available
- Staffing optimization based on occupancy patterns; internal cost data not available
***Next Analysis Recommendations:***
- Integrate competitor pricing data for family segment price sensitivity analysis
- A/B test deposit policies on 90+ day bookings
- Build predictive model for cancellation risk at booking moment

### **Reflection & Learning**
This project transformed raw hotel booking data into actionable business intelligence through:
- Hypothesis-driven analysis: Starting with clear business questions, not just "what's interesting?"
- Iterative design: Three major dashboard revisions based on clarity, not complexity
- Action-first mindset: Every insight paired with "what do we do about it?"
- User empathy: Designing for an executive with 30 seconds, not an analyst with 30 minutes
- Biggest lesson: A great insight hidden in a cluttered dashboard is the same as no insight at all. Visualization is not decoration, it's communication.
- Biggest lesson: A great insight hidden in a cluttered dashboard is the same as no insight at all. Visualization is not decoration, it's communication!
